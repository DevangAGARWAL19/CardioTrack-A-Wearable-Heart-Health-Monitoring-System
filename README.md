## 📝 **Project Description**

**CardioTrack** is a compact, wearable heart health monitoring device designed with a fully custom PCB that integrates real-time physiological sensing, data display, and user interaction. It is tailored for individuals who need consistent heart rate and oxygen saturation tracking in a convenient and portable form factor.

This project uses the **MAX30100 sensor** to detect heart rate and SpO₂ (oxygen saturation), an **OLED display** to show live readings, and a **rotary encoder** to navigate the user interface. Powered by an **Arduino Nano**, the system features a regulated power supply and a basic **battery monitoring unit**, making it suitable for low-power wearable applications.

The PCB was custom-designed using EasyEDA, allowing efficient placement of components and optimized signal routing to reduce noise and enhance accuracy. The design includes:

- 📟 **OLED Display (0.96")** to visualize heart rate and oxygen levels.
- ❤️ **MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor** to monitor heart rate and SpO2.
- 🔋 **Battery Monitoring Circuit** using BC547 transistor.
- 🔄 **Rotary Encoder Interface** for user control.
- 🧠 **Arduino Nano** as the main controller.
- ⚡ **Voltage Regulated Power Supply** with 7805.
